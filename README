darcsweb - A web interface for darcs
Alberto Bertogli (albertito@blitiri.com.ar)
---------------------------------------------

This is a very simple web interface for darcs, inspired in gitweb (written by
Kay Sievers and Christian Gierke).

To configure, copy the "config.py.sample" file to "config.py" and edit it; you
will configure your repositories there. Then just browse to the cgi file.

If you have any question, suggestions or comments, please let me know.

Thanks,
		Alberto
